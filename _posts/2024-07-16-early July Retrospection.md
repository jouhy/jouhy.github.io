## **Retrospection written after a long time**
I arrived in Irvine, 2 weeks ago.  
I am partiicipating in the Summer GREAT Program, and now I am working on-device LLM project at UC Irvine.  
To improve my English skills, I'm writing this retrospection in English....(with the help of ChatGPT...)  
  

## **Start on-device project**
This is my first time working on such a project.  
I wanted to conduct optimization or quantization experiments related to AI.  
Last week, I benchmarked by Model Size and by CPU&GPU Frequency for LLAMA.  

## **Summer Plan**
1. Achieve a TOEFL score of over 95.
2. Master Operating Systems.
3. Successfully complete the ongoing on-device LLM project.
4. Decide on future research directions and Contact research labs based on project experience.
